+Uh, look
+Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
+I'm praying that somebody hope for me
+I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
+P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
+Ready to go whenever, just let me know
+The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
+The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
+I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
+They wanna plot on my trot to the top
+I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
+I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
+And it matters more because I had it not
+Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
+Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
+Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
+Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
